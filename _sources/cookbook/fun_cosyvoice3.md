# Fun-CosyVoice3

[Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B](https://huggingface.co/FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512) is a
lightweight text-to-speech model (0.5B parameters) from the FunAudioLLM team at Alibaba.
It uses a Qwen2.5-0.5B backbone with FSQ speech tokens (vocab = 6561 + 200 special tokens),
conditioned on a CAMPPlus speaker embedding and prompt speech tokens extracted via an ONNX
speech tokenizer. It supports zero-shot voice cloning, cross-lingual synthesis, and
instruction-based style control. The model produces 24 kHz speech at a
25 Hz token frame rate through the `preprocessing → tts_engine → vocoder` pipeline and the
OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint.

## Prerequisites

Install `sglang-omni` by following [Installation](../get_started/installation.md).

Fun-CosyVoice3 depends on the `cosyvoice` package:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y sox
uv pip install "sglang-omni[fun-cosyvoice3]"
```

Clone the CosyVoice repository with its Matcha-TTS submodule and add both to `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
COSYVOICE_PATH=/path/to/CosyVoice
COSYVOICE_COMMIT=074ca6dc9e80a2f424f1f74b48bdd7d3fea531cc
MATCHA_TTS_COMMIT=dd9105b34bf2be2230f4aa1e4769fb586a3c824e

git clone --recursive https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice.git ${COSYVOICE_PATH}
git -C ${COSYVOICE_PATH} checkout ${COSYVOICE_COMMIT}
git -C ${COSYVOICE_PATH} submodule update --init --recursive
git -C ${COSYVOICE_PATH}/third_party/Matcha-TTS checkout ${MATCHA_TTS_COMMIT}
export PYTHONPATH="${COSYVOICE_PATH}:${COSYVOICE_PATH}/third_party/Matcha-TTS:$PYTHONPATH"
```

**Do not** run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the CosyVoice checkout. That file pins
`torch`, `torchaudio`, `transformers`, and `diffusers` versions that conflict with the
`sglang-omni` core pins — only the `fun-cosyvoice3` extra above and the two `PYTHONPATH`
entries are needed; the CosyVoice Flow and HiFT modules import fine against the
`sglang-omni` versions of those shared packages.

The checkpoint includes ONNX models for the speech tokenizer and speaker encoder, which use
the `onnxruntime` already pinned in `sglang-omni`'s core dependencies.

Download the checkpoint:

```bash
hf download FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512
```

## Server Configuration

The pipeline is `preprocessing → tts_engine → vocoder`. First startup can take several
minutes while the `tts_engine` captures CUDA graphs.

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512 \
  --config examples/configs/fun_cosyvoice3_0_5b.yaml \
  --port 8000
```

### Flow Decoder Batching

The buffered vocoder uses the batch-capable `FunCosyVoice3Flow.inference` API for every
request. `SimpleScheduler` collects up to 16 requests for at most 30 ms, then the vocoder
groups requests by total mel length in 50-frame buckets. Every bucket, including a
single-request bucket, calls the same built-in Flow inference method; packing, padding,
masking, CFM Euler/CFG, and output unpadding are handled inside the Flow implementation.
The 50-frame default matches the current DiT estimator's static chunk size; a larger bucket
can combine more requests at the cost of additional padding, compute, and peak GPU memory.

The scheduler uses a bucket-rounded Flow admission budget, configured by
`flow_batch_admission_frames` (8,000 by default). It controls whether a later request joins the
current Flow batch; it is not a maximum supported request length. A request whose total
prompt-plus-output mel length exceeds that budget runs as a B=1 Flow batch through the same
adapter, and later requests wait for the next scheduler batch. This preserves valid long
generations while preventing them from being combined with more work.

HiFT is batched the same way: the mels from one Flow bucket are right-zero-padded into a single
tensor, decoded in one HiFT call, and sliced back to each request's true length, under the
padding budget `hift_max_padding_waste` (1.5 by default; `1.0` only groups requests that need no
padding at all). HiFT is prepared for this at load time by folding away its `weight_norm`
parametrizations. Right-zero-padding matches the zero padding HiFT applies in single-request
inference, so batched output is identical except in the final mel frame of padded requests.

The built-in Flow implementation supports the pinned CosyVoice PyTorch estimator, an opt-in
TensorRT estimator (see below), and buffered `streaming=False, finalize=True` inference only.

Change the mel-frame bucket size, for example to 100 frames:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512 \
  --config examples/configs/fun_cosyvoice3_0_5b.yaml \
  --port 8000 \
  --vocoder.factory.flow_batch_bucket_frames 100
```

The same setting can be written in the pipeline config under the vocoder's
`factory` group:

```yaml
stages:
  vocoder:
    factory:
      flow_batch_bucket_frames: 100
```

Increase the normal Flow batching budget only after measuring the target GPU. This changes the
maximum aggregate padded work admitted into one scheduler batch; it does not reject a longer
single request.

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512 \
  --config examples/configs/fun_cosyvoice3_0_5b.yaml \
  --port 8000 \
  --vocoder.factory.flow_batch_admission_frames 4000
```

The YAML equivalent is:

```yaml
stages:
  vocoder:
    factory:
      flow_batch_admission_frames: 4000
```

The remaining vocoder `factory` options are `max_batch_size` (16) and `max_batch_wait_ms` (30)
for the scheduler batch, `dtype` (`bfloat16`) for the Flow autocast, `hift_dtype` (`float32`,
independent of `dtype`; `bfloat16` measured no faster for HiFT on H200 and lowers output fidelity)
for the HiFT autocast, `enable_dit_torch_compile`, and `enable_flow_estimator_trt`
(see below; mutually exclusive DiT accelerators). The
`tts_engine` stage takes `onnx_intra_op_threads` (16) for the speech tokenizer and speaker
encoder ONNX sessions, and `preprocessing` takes `max_concurrency` (8) for concurrent reference
conditioning.

The built-in Flow implementation is tied to the Flow/CFM structure in the documented CosyVoice commit
`074ca6dc9e80a2f424f1f74b48bdd7d3fea531cc`. It does not patch the CosyVoice source on disk; an
incompatible Flow structure fails directly instead of using a fallback implementation.

### torch.compile for the DiT backbone

The flow decoder's DiT backbone (`flow.decoder.estimator`, a 22-layer DiT invoked
once per Euler step) is compiled with `torch.compile` to reduce per-step
kernel-launch overhead. It is on by default unless the TensorRT estimator below
is enabled. The compile pays a one-time cost of about 100 s at startup with an
empty inductor cache and uses `dynamic=True`, so one symbolic-sequence-length
graph serves every utterance length.

Run the estimator eager instead by overriding the vocoder stage's `factory` args
(the `stages.` prefix is implied in the CLI dotted path), for example to shorten
startup during development:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512 \
  --config examples/configs/fun_cosyvoice3_0_5b.yaml \
  --vocoder.factory.enable_dit_torch_compile false \
  --port 8000
```

### TensorRT for the DiT backbone

The same `flow.decoder.estimator` can be replaced with a TensorRT engine built
from the checkpoint's bundled ONNX (`flow.decoder.estimator.fp32.onnx` is
preferred). This is opt-in: TensorRT is not a `sglang-omni` extra, first
startup builds and caches a `.plan` under `COSYVOICE3_TRT_CACHE` or
`~/.cache/sglang-omni/cosyvoice3_trt`, and the official CosyVoice ONNX freezes
CFG batch at 2 (t and spks are static; only the mel time dim is dynamic).
The engine is attached as an `nn.Module` wrapper (`FlowEstimatorTRTModule`)
so CosyVoice does not take its raw `execute_async_v3` path. Packed Flow
(CFG batch = `2 * request_batch`) still works by chunking request-wise
cond/uncond pairs into that CFG=2 engine; out-of-profile `T` falls back to
the original PyTorch DiT.

TensorRT and `torch.compile` both replace the same DiT, so they are mutually
exclusive. Enabling TensorRT skips the default compile on its own, setting both
flags to true is rejected:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512 \
  --config examples/configs/fun_cosyvoice3_0_5b.yaml \
  --vocoder.factory.enable_flow_estimator_trt true \
  --port 8000
```

On one H200, packed Flow + HiFT (80 target tokens, 25 prompt tokens,
6 timed iters after 2 warmups) was:

| Backend | B | Flow latency | Vocoder RTF |
|---|---|---|---|
| eager | 1 | 1131 ms | 0.359 |
| torch.compile | 1 | 1070 ms | 0.340 |
| TensorRT (CFG batch=2 engine) | 1 | 20 ms | 0.012 |
| eager | 4 | 267 ms | 0.026 |
| torch.compile | 4 | 220 ms | 0.022 |
| TensorRT (chunked 4× CFG pairs) | 4 | 77 ms | 0.011 |

TensorRT here is not bit-exact with eager PyTorch (FP16 TensorRT tactics on
the fp32 ONNX; cosine similarity about 0.995 on one packed mel).

The same three vocoder backends on the full SeedTTS EN set (1088 samples),
buffered `/v1/audio/speech` (non-streaming, generate-only), one H200, 0
failures. ASR WER was not remeasured; vocoder-only mel cosine vs eager is
about 0.995.

| Backend | Concurrency | Latency mean | RTF mean | Throughput |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| eager | 1 | 1.091 s | 0.241 | 0.916 req/s |
| torch.compile | 1 | 1.016 s | 0.221 | 0.984 req/s |
| TensorRT | 1 | 0.871 s | 0.189 | 1.147 req/s |
| eager | 16 | 5.690 s | 1.300 | 2.800 req/s |
| torch.compile | 16 | 3.151 s | 0.706 | 5.059 req/s |
| TensorRT | 16 | 2.549 s | 0.570 | 6.243 req/s |

At concurrency 1 the pipeline is still mostly preprocessing + AR, so TensorRT
is about 1.17× `torch.compile`. At concurrency 16 the vocoder is the bottleneck
and TensorRT is about 1.23× compile throughput (2.23× eager). It remains
opt-in because TensorRT is a separate install and the first engine build takes
about a minute.

## Synthesizing Speech

### Zero-shot Voice Cloning

CosyVoice3 clones a voice from a short reference audio clip. `ref_audio` can be a local
path, file URL, data URL, or HTTP URL. `ref_text` (the transcript of the reference clip)
is optional but recommended for better alignment.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512",
    "input": "SGLang-Omni makes text-to-speech fast and easy to deploy.",
    "ref_audio": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
    "ref_text": "We asked over twenty different people, and they all said it was his."
  }' \
  --output output.wav
```

#### Python

```python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "model": "FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512",
        "input": "Get the trust fund to the bank early.",
        "ref_audio": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
        "ref_text": "We asked over twenty different people, and they all said it was his.",
    },
)
resp.raise_for_status()
with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(resp.content)
```

### Cross-lingual Synthesis

CosyVoice3 supports cross-lingual voice cloning where the reference speaker speaks a
different language than the synthesis text. Omit `ref_text` to enter cross-lingual mode.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512",
    "input": "今天天气真好，我们一起出去散步吧。",
    "ref_audio": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav"
  }' \
  --output output.wav
```

### Instruction-based Style Control

Pass `instructions` to guide prosody, emotion, or speaking style:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512",
    "input": "Welcome to our annual developer conference.",
    "ref_audio": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
    "instructions": "Speak in a cheerful and energetic tone, as if addressing a large audience."
  }' \
  --output output.wav
```

### Speed Control

Adjust playback speed with `speed` (default `1.0`):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512",
    "input": "This is spoken at one point three times normal speed.",
    "ref_audio": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
    "speed": 1.3
  }' \
  --output output.wav
```

### Streaming

Incremental Flow + HiFT decoding is enabled. Set `stream: true` and use
`response_format: "pcm"` so the server can emit audio before speech-token
generation finishes.

The vocoder follows CosyVoice3's causal chunk loop: 25 speech tokens per hop
(`pre_lookahead_len=3`, 25 Hz → about 1 s of audio per chunk). The first PCM
chunk is emitted once the AR stage has produced `28 + prompt_pad` tokens,
where `prompt_pad` (0–24) rounds the Flow prompt-token length up to a
multiple of 25. Later hops grow 25 → 50 → 100 tokens like the upstream
`CosyVoice3Model` (default; keep growth on). Each scheduler step runs at most
one hop per request so a backlogged stream cannot monopolize the GPU.
Non-streaming requests still decode the whole utterance in one Flow + HiFT
pass.

Optional serving knobs (vocoder factory; keep `tts_engine.factory.token_hop_len`
in sync if you change the hop):

| Factory arg | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `token_hop_len` | `25` | Base hop / AR follow-up flush; must match training chunk size |
| `token_max_hop_len` | `100` | Cap for `25 → 50 → 100` growth |
| `disable_hop_growth` | `false` | Leave off unless A/B'ing; growth ON was better at c=16 |

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512",
    "input": "Get the trust fund to the bank early.",
    "ref_audio": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
    "ref_text": "We asked over twenty different people, and they all said it was his.",
    "stream": true,
    "response_format": "pcm"
  }' \
  --output output.pcm
```

## Generation Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | served model | Served model identifier |
| `input` | (required) | Text to synthesize |
| `ref_audio` | `null` | Reference audio for voice cloning (path / URL / data URL) |
| `ref_text` | `null` | Transcript of the reference audio. Improves cloning quality; omit for cross-lingual mode |

| `seed` | `null` | Random seed for reproducibility |
| `stream` | `false` | Incremental causal Flow + HiFT; first PCM chunk after `28 + prompt_pad` speech tokens (`prompt_pad` rounds the prompt length to a multiple of 25) |

## Benchmarking

Measure causal streaming with Seed-TTS-Eval against a running server:

```bash
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_tts_seedtts \
  --model FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512 \
  --port 8000 --lang en --max-concurrency 16 \
  --use-existing-server --generate-only --stream \
  --output-dir results/fun_cosyvoice3_en
```

Use `--lang zh --no-ref-text` for the Chinese cross-lingual split. See
`benchmarks/README.md` for the full workflow.

## Known Limitations

- **Reference audio required.** CosyVoice3 requires a reference audio clip for voice
  cloning; it does not support text-only synthesis without a speaker reference.
- **30-second limit.** Reference audio must be 30 seconds or shorter for speech token
  extraction.
- **Speaker similarity.** Providing `ref_text` (the transcript) yields better voice
  similarity than omitting it (cross-lingual mode).
- **Reference shape.** The endpoint accepts either `ref_audio` plus optional `ref_text`,
  or one item in `references`; multiple references are rejected for this checkpoint.
- **Prompt modes.** Provide either `ref_text` or `instructions` for the reference prompt,
  not both. `instructions` selects CosyVoice3 `instruct2` conditioning.
- **Reference conditioning cache.** Local files, data URLs, and byte payloads are cached
  by audio content and encoder configuration. Mutable HTTP URLs are intentionally encoded
  on every request instead of being cached by URL alone.
- **Speed control.** Applied once, on the decoded waveform, by the shared
  `/v1/audio/speech` response-encoding path.
- **Voice conversion.** Voice conversion is outside the current zero-shot TTS scope.
- **Streaming decode.** Causal Flow + HiFT emit PCM after each hop
  (`pre_lookahead_len=3`; hop grows 25 → 50 → 100 by default). Quality can
  differ slightly from the buffered whole-utterance path. Opt-in TensorRT
  (`enable_flow_estimator_trt`) also accelerates streaming hops; do not enable
  it together with `enable_dit_torch_compile`. TRT freezes DiT attention, so
  streaming+TRT is not bit-exact with PyTorch streaming. Keep the Module TRT
  wrapper when streaming: CosyVoice's raw TRT enqueue is incompatible with
  packed hop-batch CFG shapes.
- **Flow batch scope.** Flow batching supports the CosyVoice PyTorch estimator
  and the opt-in TensorRT estimator. HiFT batches only the mels produced by one
  Flow bucket while padding waste stays within `hift_max_padding_waste`.
  Streaming coalesces first/follow-up hops across requests
  (`_can_batch_stream_chunks`, short peer wait) so TTFP stays low under load.
- **cosyvoice dependency.** The `cosyvoice` package has no PyPI release and must be
  installed from GitHub. Matcha-TTS is a required submodule and must also be importable;
  only the CosyVoice Flow and HiFT paths are used by the vocoder.
