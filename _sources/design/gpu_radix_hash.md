# Capture-safe GPU radix hash (MOSS-TTS Local generated rows)

## Problem

Every decoded frame on the Local v1.5 path appends one radix-cache token id to
the request's KV chain; the radix tree keys on those ids. Because the text
channel alone is the same assistant-slot id for every continuing frame, the key
must hash the **full** 13-channel row (text + 12 RVQ codes) so that a radix
prefix match implies identical audio content (otherwise a re-prefill after
retraction could falsely prefix-match into another identical-prompt request's
cached generated region).

The previous generated-row key reused the prompt-path helper
`moss_tts.request_builders.build_row_cache_key_ids`, which moves the row tensor
to host (`row.numpy().tobytes()`) and hashes with blake2b. On the prompt path
that is fine -- it runs once, before decode, outside any CUDA-graph capture
region. On the **generated**-row path it runs every decode step on a tensor the
local-frame decode just produced on device, so it forces a
GPU->CPU sync + host hashing + CPU->GPU upload of `next_token_ids` **per frame**.
That host sync blocks CUDA-graph capture and the async-decode lookahead
(#734 / #736), which this PR is preparing the path for.

## Approach

`sglang_omni/models/moss_tts_local/radix_hash.py` fuses token-row construction
and radix hashing into one Triton kernel on CUDA. The hash algorithm is
unchanged; inputs unsupported by the Triton path use the original int64 Torch
implementation:

```
acc = 0
for channel in range(C):                       # C is fixed by the model configuration
    acc = (acc * BASE + row[:, channel]) % MOD
key = acc % HASH_SPACE                          # continuing frames
key = audio_end_id                              # EOS rows (torch.where)
```

* `MOD = 2**31 - 1` (Mersenne prime M31), `BASE = 1_000_000_007` (prime < MOD).
* `HASH_SPACE = 151643` -- `<|endoftext|>` opens the special/control id band.
  Continuing keys fold strictly below it; EOS rows keep the raw `audio_end` id
  (in the band) so `Req._check_vocab_boundary_finish` still fires eos.

The prompt path is **unchanged**: `build_row_cache_key_ids` (blake2b) stays for
prompt preprocessing. Generated rows now use `build_rows_and_radix_token_ids`
to fuse row construction and GPU hashing. This boundary is deliberate -- the prompt hash
is not on the decode hot path and never enters a capture region.

## Capture-safety argument

The Triton kernels compute the hash entirely on device, without host readback
or synchronization. In serving, hashing runs after frame decoding, whether
frame decoding uses CUDA graph replay or eager execution. Hashing itself is
not currently captured. Tests verify capture and replay after explicit kernel
warmup. The Torch fallback remains capture-safe on CUDA.

### No int64 overflow

With `acc < MOD` and each channel value reduced `< MOD` (both `< 2**31`) and
`BASE < MOD`, every Horner step `acc * BASE + v < 2**31 * 2**31 = 2**62`, well
inside signed int64 (`< 2**63`). So the arithmetic is exact and bit-reproducible
on CPU and GPU -- no implementation-defined wraparound. This is asserted in
`test_matches_python_reference` against a pure-Python bignum reference.

## Collision analysis

The key only drives radix cache hit/miss; it never changes sampled output (see
two-layer verification below). A clash matters only when two **distinct** audio
rows produce the same key **and** sit on top of an otherwise identical full
prefix -- the same risk profile the prior blake2b-then-fold key already carried.

* Raw polynomial space is `MOD ~ 2.1e9`. Horner is order-sensitive (a channel
  permutation changes the key) and spreads neighbours (a single-channel +/-1
  shifts the key by a power of `BASE mod MOD`), so structurally similar rows do
  not cluster. Raw-hash injectivity on a constructed adjacent/permuted/random
  batch is asserted in `test_no_collisions_on_adjacent_and_permuted_rows`.
* The fold to `HASH_SPACE = 151643` is the operative space (identical to the
  prior key's fold). Expected folded clashes for `n` co-resident generated rows
  on a shared prefix are `~ n^2 / (2 * 151643)` -- e.g. < 0.02 for n = 75. A fold
  clash degrades to a single-position radix false-match (~1/151643) that only
  takes effect atop an identical full prefix; it cannot corrupt output, only
  cache locality.

## Two-layer verification rubric

Replacing the key algorithm means the old "both sides run the same blake2b"
parity assumption no longer holds, so verification splits into two independent
layers:

1. **Output layer (bit-identity).** `audio_codes` / `output_ids` are produced by
   sampling, which does **not** depend on the radix key value. The fixed-seed S0
   gate (`tests/unit_test/moss_tts_local/test_s0_gate.py`, gpu-marked) and the
   graph-vs-eager sentinel assert bit-identical decoded output before vs after
   this change. **Status: PASS** (H100 at the review head: S0 3/3, the
   graph-vs-eager sentinel, and the on-GPU `moss_tts_local` suite).
2. **Key layer (algorithm properties).** Determinism, collision behaviour, EOS
   preservation, output domain, and dtype/device-follow are covered as CPU unit
   tests in `tests/unit_test/moss_tts_local/test_radix_hash.py` (green on CPU).

The output layer is the behaviour-neutrality guarantee; the key layer pins the
hash's own contract independent of any GPU run.
