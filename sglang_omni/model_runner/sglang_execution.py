"""SGLang execution-contract adapter.

SGLang's scheduler/worker boundary is an explicit protocol:

* decode tokens cross iterations through FutureMap; and
* decode lookahead isolates forward-only sampling state while
  ForwardBatch.init_new applies per-forward overrides passed as explicit
  keyword arguments, never by mutating the batch.

Omni owns its scheduler loop and model-runner wrapper, so it cannot rely on
sglang.srt.managers.scheduler.Scheduler.run_batch to provide that protocol.
This adapter is the single compatibility boundary used by both synchronous and
lookahead execution.

Upstream's protocol also splits scheduler writes and model forwards onto
separate CUDA streams, fenced by the decode CUDA-graph read-done event. That
two-stream contract belongs to the upstream-style overlap loop, which Omni
refuses to run (OmniScheduler._event_loop_overlap raises), so this bridge
is deliberately single-stream: launch-current/resolve-previous on one stream.
